Before uninstalling you should stop all running services, otherwise there might
be problems with existing pid-files on Linux and Mac the next time you install it. You can
have a look on how to do so [here](../basic-usage#start-and-stop-scripts).

To uninstall appserver.io on Linux, you can rely on your package management system.
On Windows, you can use the normal uninstall process provided by the operating system.

Under Mac OS X, you can simply delete the `/opt/appserver` folder that contains all installed files.
